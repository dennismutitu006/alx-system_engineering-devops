Wondering what happens when you search something on your browser?

Behind the scenes, a number of actions take place when you type google.com into your browser and hit Enter. Let’s delve into each step of this intricate process:

Requesting DNS (Domain Name System):Your computer initiates a DNS query to a DNS server. The purpose is to convert the human-readable domain name (e.g., www.google.com) into an IP address that the network can recognize.
The DNS server searches its records and returns the corresponding IP address to your browser.
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):Once your computer obtains the web server’s IP address, it establishes a connection using the TCP/IP protocol.
TCP divides data into packets and ensures their reliable delivery, while the IP protocol routes these packets to the correct destination.
Firewall:Before the connection is fully established, your computer’s firewall scrutinizes the packets to ensure they are not malicious.
A firewall acts as a security device, monitoring and regulating incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.
HTTPS/SSL (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure/Secure Sockets Layer):Upon successful connection, an HTTPS session begins. This secure version of HTTP encrypts data exchanged between your computer and the web server.
SSL or TLS protocols ensure that the data remains confidential during transmission, preventing interception by third parties.
Load-balancer:The request is then sent to a load balancer, which distributes incoming network traffic across multiple web servers.
Load balancers help balance the load on each server, preventing any single server from being overwhelmed.
Web Server:One of the web servers receives the HTTPS request from the load balancer.
The web server processes the request, locating the necessary resource or web page, and sends the response back to your computer.
Application Server:In some cases, the web server may lack the required information to fulfill the request.
It then forwards the request to an application server, which handles more complex tasks or retrieves data from databases.
Database:If needed, the application server interacts with a database to retrieve specific data.
The requested data is then incorporated into the web server’s response and sent back to your browser.
In conclusion, typing google.com into your browser sets in motion a series of intricate processes involving DNS requests, TCP/IP communication, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL encryption, load balancers, web servers, application servers and databases.
